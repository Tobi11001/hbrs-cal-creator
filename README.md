# H-BRS Cal Creator

A web application to create an iCal file for selected courses at H-BRS. This is useful for students who want to import
their courses into their calendar application, without having to manually enter each course manually.

> **Note:** This project is not affiliated with Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg. It is a private project by students for
> students.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive user interface
- 1:1 conversion of teaching events to iCal (respecting odd and even weeks)
- Completely free and open-source, possible to self-host on your own server

## Usage

This project is still in development. When it becomes more stable, it will be hosted online for everyone to use, and I
will provide extensive documentation on how to self-host it.
